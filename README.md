A Eurorack adaptation of the [Bastl Kastle](https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/kastle).

This is almost entirely based specifically on the [Sluisbrinkie Kepler](https://github.com/niektb/sluisbrinkie-eurorack-published/tree/main/Sluisbrinkie%20Kepler). There were no hardware files available so I decided to venture into laying out my own.

Eschews the switches of the original for purely potentiometers and mono jacks.</br>
Includes header for power via external +5VDC source.
